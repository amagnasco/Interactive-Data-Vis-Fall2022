    <h3>Section 2 | Time Series</h3>
    <div>
      I derived this dataset from publicly available vital statistics of the NYC Dept. of Health. 
      Values represent the birth rates in NYC by community district, from 2000-2017. 
      Each borough-year is the rate of live births per 1000 population, median across all districts in that borough. Area chart below is for Brooklyn.
      Of note: the dotcom burst, 2008 crisis, and Hurricane Sandy. Chart shouldn't end at 0 (bug).
