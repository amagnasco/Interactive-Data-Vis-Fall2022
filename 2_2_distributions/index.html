    <h3>Section 2 | Distributions</h3>
    <div>
      This is an anonymized version of a dataset that I derived from official NYC data sources. Each dot is a building in NYC that had housing violations in 2015.
      Key: The X axis is the count of class C violations (critical) issued to that building.
      The Y axis is the count of repairs made to that building.
      Red dots were placed in the following year's Alternative Enforcement Program and blue aren't.
      Dots are sized by the sum dollar cost of repairs done by the City on those buildings.
